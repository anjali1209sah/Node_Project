A client is using a dashboard. He inputs a number from 1 to 25 {For eg - 5}. That number automatically gets multiplied by 7. 
1) If final number after multiplied by 7, is greater than 140, then its goes to file A. 
2) If final number after multiplied by 7, is greater than 100, then its goes to file B
3) If final number after multiplied by 7, is greater than 60 then its goes to file C. 

4) And all other numbers goes to file D

Once a number is stored in all files (A to D), the user canâ€™t enter any new number and the process gets complete 

Also list (display) all numbers saved in all 4 files
